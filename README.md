# 🧠 AI Interview Assistant

A web-based AI-powered platform that simulates real interview experiences using NLP, video analysis, and interactive dashboards. Designed to help students and job seekers prepare confidently for interviews while giving employers a data-driven screening tool.

> 👨‍💻 Built as a collaborative team project by 4 members. This repository showcases my personal involvement and contributions, particularly in **machine learning model development** and **data gathering for AI training**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎤 Interview Simulation
- Conduct mock interviews tailored to specific job roles and industries.
- Includes behavioral, situational, and technical question categories.

### 🧠 AI Feedback Engine
- Uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze verbal responses.
- Provides **real-time scoring** and feedback based on tone, fluency, and relevance.

### 🎥 Emotion-Based Video Evaluation
- Candidate responses recorded via webcam.
- Analyzed using **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** to detect emotions like happy, anxious, neutral, etc.
- Visual feedback helps users understand **non-verbal cues**.

### 📊 Interactive Dashboards
- Built with **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Candidates receive visualized analytics of their performance:
  - Emotion timelines
  - Response strength
  - Confidence indicators
- Tracks user progress over multiple attempts.

### 🛠️ Custom Question Generator
- Dynamic question pool generated based on:
  - Job description
  - Domain knowledge
  - Skill tags
